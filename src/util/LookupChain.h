// Back-navigation stack for chained dictionary lookups, stored compactly.
//
// Instead of owning a copy of each prior headword (a std::string per entry —
// multi-word phrase lookups make these heap-allocated and unbounded), each entry
// references the headword's position in the persisted lookup-history log by
// distance-from-newest, plus the page the user was reading. The owning activity
// resolves the actual word from the history log at that index when navigating
// back (which also re-derives the canonical title for stem/alt-form lookups).
//
// Two load-bearing invariants (documented because a naive impl gets them wrong):
//   1. Indices are distance-from-the-NEWEST history entry, so they stay valid
//      under front-eviction (oldest entries dropping out of the capped log).
//      An oldest=0 index would drift as the log evicts.
//   2. Stored indices are a NON-CONTIGUOUS subset of history positions. A
//      back-then-forward leaves the abandoned branch in the log as a gap
//      (back-nav neither logs nor removes). Example: chain A→B→C, back to B,
//      forward to D ⇒ log [A,B,C,D], stack [A@3, B@2], skipping the gap C@1.
//      The stack tracks exact positions, gaps and all.
//
// Pure: no I/O, no SD, no settings — host-unit-testable. The activity owns the
// history-log resolution and the cap value.
